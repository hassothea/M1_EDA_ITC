    "**Objective:** In practice, real insights from data often require data transformation and manipulation. `Data wrangling` is the process of cleaning, structuring, and organizing raw data into a usable format. It involves tasks like handling missing values, correcting errors, and transforming data to make it suitable for analysis. In this TP, you will learn how to perform some important tasks of data wrangling including: Creating, loading, changing types, aggregating, merging and manipulating data frames in `pandas`...\n",
